					<p>I've been coding on and off for almost 20 years. My brother & I had a basic website while we were in highschool and I entered The University of Scranton in 1997 as a Computer Science major. I have worked for ~15 years doing programming on a proprietary platform at a small market research company in Edgewater, NJ. I'm currently enrolled in the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp to improve my knowledge base.</p>

					<p>I am familiar with HTML & Javascript and have some experience with PHP, MYSQL, Python, JQuery & JAVA. I've also had code running on an Arduino. I have lots of ideas that I would like to pursue once my ability catches up with my imagination.</p>
					
					<p>I try to be very active. The picture above is from my recent trip to Beijing where I hiked a section of the Great Wall. This year I have been learning how to surf, snowboard & wakeboard. When I'm not outside I am usually reading & sampling a variety of whiskeys.</p>
